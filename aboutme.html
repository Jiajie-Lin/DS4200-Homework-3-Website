            Hello I am JJ, I am a second year at Northeastern studying Data Science and Business Administration 
            with a concentration in Fintech. I have been interested in Computer Science since a kid and switched to Data 
            Science when I got to college. I have experience in building dashboards and building data visualizations. 

            My interests include games, audiobooks, swimming and cooking. I have been playing games my whole life, I was vice 
            president of the Table Top Gaming Club during highschool and cook weekly meals every Sunday. Usually a medium rare 
            New York Strip.

    <h2>
        Here I will talk about Maplestory, one of the games that I play. Maplestory is a open world, 2D, side to side, platform, mmorpg. 
        In the game there is more than one class, each class has more than one skill. The goal of the game is to level up, to fight stronger stuff
        then to level up fast using stronger stuff. It is really good at wasting your time.
